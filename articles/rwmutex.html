<p>Maybe you're converting some old algorithm to be concurrent, and channels feel like an awkward fit.
Maybe you've profiled your project and found that locking plain mutexes is a big box on the cumulative call graph.
Maybe you like to read through Go documentation when you're bored (ha ha, who would do that!) and you keep thinking about the delicacy that is package sync.
Regardless of what brought you to this point, you want to know whether RWMutex is a good fit for your code.</p>
<p>The only way to know for sure whether RWMutex is the best choice is to try it. Think about the code it leads you to write from the perspective of a maintainer, or someone new to the project. Then benchmark and profile to collect data to drive your decisions.</p>
<p>Of course, that is a non-trivial amount of work. That's where this article comes in.</p>
<p>Building knowledge, rather than just intuition, about when RWMutex is appropriate takes some background. In this article, I'll assume that you're a programmer who knows how to write software in Go. I'll assume you understand how to write concurrent programs that are free of race conditions, or at least you understand why mutexes are useful. I'll assume you are aware of, but not very familiar with, assembly (there will be some) and hardware concerns like cache coherency (there will be a lot). And, to simplify things, I'll assume the target is amd64; some details will be different for other multi-processor architectures, and little of this will apply to single-threaded ones.</p>
<p>Also note that the Go version current as of writing is 1.16. There are some important changes to many details that may land... eventually. See <a href="https://golang.org/issue/37142" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this issue</a>.</p>
<p>The code snippets in this post are derived directly from the source code of package sync <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/tree/release-branch.go1.16/src/sync" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available on GitHub</a>. In general, I will be removing lines of code specific to the race detector.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#2."><h2 id="2.">Atomic Operations</h2></a>
<p>RWMutex is a synchronization primitive, a building block for larger algorithms that allow programs with concurrent execution to have consistent behavior. Mutex is another synchronization primitive. So are channels.</p>
<p>The most basic type of synchronization primitive is the atomic operation. These are single statements that are implemented by the compiler in a special way to ensure that any other atomic operation (which wasn't in the past) on the same variable will always observe the result of the current one. To use the language of the Go memory model, atomic operations are always strictly in <em>happens before</em> order – they never <em>happen concurrently</em>. Ironically, if an algorithm has no operations that <em>happen concurrently</em> with a write, we say the algorithm is &quot;concurrent.&quot;</p>
<p>Arguably the most important atomic operation is the atomic compare-and-swap, or CAS. It does what its name suggests: swap the value of a variable for a new one if and only if it is instantaneously equal to some other given value, and indicate to the processor whether the swap happened. x86 has a special instruction to implement it: <code>LOCK CMPXCHG</code>. (<code>LOCK</code> is an instruction prefix, essentially the x86 name for &quot;atomic.&quot; More on it later.) The details of how assembly instructions map to CPU cycles are complicated, but a decent analogy would be that if this were Python or Javascript instead of machine code, there would be a built-in function for CAS.</p>
<p>Other common atomic operations include things like loading, storing, adding, and exchanging; these are exactly the functions available in package sync/atomic. As an aside, there are other atomic operations not directly available in Go. Test-and-set sets a single bit to 1 and returns the value it had prior. x86 also provides atomic versions of bitwise <code>NOT</code>, <code>AND</code>, <code>NAND</code>, <code>OR</code>, and <code>XOR</code>, as well as subtraction, negation, and fetch-and-add. Furthermore, any operation on a single value can be made atomic by using CAS in a loop, and more complicated protocols can be derived to make large classes of lock-free concurrent algorithms.</p>
<p>&quot;Atomic&quot; has a double meaning. I've been talking about how they're like indivisible operations in concurrent algorithms, but they also serve as the most basic, fundamental pieces of larger algorithms like mutexes and semaphores (which are like mutexes that can be locked a chosen number of times at once), all the way up to highly versatile data structures like <code>sync.Map</code>. We're going to see a lot of atomic operations as we tour through Mutex and RWMutex, and they're going to be constantly in the background of our analysis of the performance of those types.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#3."><h2 id="3.">Mutex</h2></a>
<p>For more context, let's look at the plain sync.Mutex:</p>
<pre><code>type Mutex struct {
    state int32
    sema  uint32
}
</code></pre>
<p>Size will be important later, so let's pay attention to the fact that a Mutex is eight bytes. The way <code>Lock</code> works is surprisingly simple:</p>
<pre><code>func (m *Mutex) Lock() {
    if atomic.CompareAndSwapInt32(&amp;m.state, 0, 1) {
        return
    }
    m.lockSlow()
}

func (m *Mutex) lockSlow() {
    iter := 0
    wakeMeFirst := false
    for {
        if iter &lt; maxSpins() {
            if atomic.CompareAndSwapInt32(&amp;m.state, 0, 1) {
                return
            }
            iter++
            continue
        }
        m.starving()
        sleepOnSemaphore(&amp;m.sema, wakeMeFirst)
        iter = 0
        wakeMeFirst = true
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>CAS is the core of the mutex algorithm – in any language, not just in Go. (Well, technically speaking, a mutex can also be implemented using test-and-set or fetch-and-add, but CAS can solve all problems those can and more.) Locking a mutex really means detecting when this goroutine is able to atomically change the value of the mutex state.</p>
<p><code>lockSlow</code> is the &quot;slow path&quot; of <code>Lock</code>, extracted so that the compiler can inline <code>Lock</code> itself to avoid the function call overhead. <code>lockSlow</code> is big and a lil scary, but conceptually, it tries a few times to acquire the mutex, does some magic with the runtime to implement &quot;starvation mode,&quot; and puts the waiting goroutine to sleep until its semaphore is released.</p>
<p>At the other end of the protocol, we have <code>Unlock</code>:</p>
<pre><code>func (m *Mutex) Unlock() {
    new := atomic.AddInt32(&amp;m.state, -1)
    if new != 0 {
        // m.lockSlow set some flags, or m wasn't locked.
        m.unlockSlow(new)
    }
}

func (m *Mutex) unlockSlow(new int32) {
    if new &lt; 0 {
        unrecoverablePanic(&quot;sync: unlock of unlocked mutex&quot;)
    }
    wakeWaiter(&amp;m.sema)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Again, <code>unlockSlow</code> is an outlined path so that <code>Unlock</code> can be inlined, and it is a little more complicated than I'm showing here (although much simpler than <code>lockSlow</code>).</p>
<p>We can summarize the Mutex algorithm as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquiring the mutex: loop until <code>CAS(mutex.state from 0 to 1)</code>.</li>
<li>Releasing the mutex: if <code>Atomic(mutex.state += -1) &lt; 0</code> then panic.</li>
</ul>


<a class="permalink" href="#4."><h2 id="4.">RWMutex</h2></a>
<p>Now that we know what Mutex looks like, let's look at RWMutex.</p>
<pre><code>type RWMutex struct {
    w           Mutex  // held if there are pending writers
    writerSem   uint32 // semaphore for writers to wait for completing readers
    readerSem   uint32 // semaphore for readers to wait for completing writers
    readerCount int32  // number of pending readers
    readerWait  int32  // number of departing readers
}
</code></pre>
<p>The Mutex in the first field is eight bytes, so an RWMutex is twenty-four bytes on its own. An RWMutex being sixteen bytes larger than a Mutex probably isn't going to mean the difference between a functioning program and heap exhaustion, but we'll see how it's an important difference later.</p>
<p>For now, the important observation is that not only does an RWMutex include a Mutex, but it also has many additional fields, which implies additional work. Let's break down <code>RLock</code>:</p>
<pre><code>func (rw *RWMutex) RLock() {
    if atomic.AddInt32(&amp;rw.readerCount, 1) &lt; 0 {
        // A writer is pending, wait for it.
        // Pseudocode:
        sleepOnSemaphore(&amp;rw.readerSem, false)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In Mutex.Lock, <code>sleepOnSemaphore</code> (the real function is <code>semacquire1</code> in package runtime) was a part of the slow path; here, it's the whole thing. We're using an atomic add rather than CAS so that we can track multiple readers; we'll see later that <code>Lock</code> ensures readerCount is negative while the rwmutex is locked for writing. All in all, <code>RLock</code> amounts to essentially the same amount of work that <code>Mutex.Lock</code> does in the happy path, and quite a bit less in the slow path. Perfect for a read-mostly lock, as advertised.</p>
<p><code>RUnlock</code> is very similar to <code>RLock</code>, atomically adding -1 to decrement the count, but it does have a full outlined slow path:</p>
<pre><code>const rwmutexMaxReaders = 1 &lt;&lt; 30

func (rw *RWMutex) RUnlock() {
    if r := atomic.AddInt32(&amp;rw.readerCount, -1); r &lt; 0 {
        rw.rUnlockSlow(r)
    }
}

func (rw *RWMutex) rUnlockSlow(readerCount int32) {
    // Precondition: readerCount &lt; 0
    if readerCount+1 == 0 || readerCount+1 == -rwmutexMaxReaders {
        // Pseudocode:
        unrecoverablePanic(&quot;sync: RUnlock of unlocked RWMutex&quot;)
    }
    // A writer is pending.
    if atomic.AddInt32(&amp;rw.readerWait, -1) == 0 {
        // The last reader unblocks the writer.
        // Pseudocode:
        wakeWaiter(&amp;rw.writerSem)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Still nothing too complicated. But we've also only seen mentions of half the fields in the RWMutex. The rest are needed for the details of the (writer) <code>Lock</code> and <code>Unlock</code> methods.</p>
<pre><code>func (rw *RWMutex) Lock() {
    // First, resolve competition with other writers.
    rw.w.Lock()
    // Announce to readers that there is a pending writer.
    r := atomic.AddInt32(&amp;rw.readerCount, -rwmutexMaxReaders) + rwmutexMaxReaders
    // Wait for active readers.
    if r != 0 &amp;&amp; atomic.AddInt32(&amp;rw.readerWait, r) != 0 {
        // Pseudocode:
        sleepOnSemaphore(&amp;rw.writerSem, false)
    }
}

func (rw *RWMutex) Unlock() {
    // Announce to readers that there is no active writer.
    r := atomic.AddInt32(&amp;rw.readerCount, rwmutexMaxReaders)
    if r &gt;= rwmutexMaxReaders {
        // Pseudocode:
        unrecoverablePanic(&quot;sync: Unlock of unlocked RWMutex&quot;)
    }
    // Unblock blocked readers, if any.
    for i := 0; i &lt; int(r); i++ {
        // Pseudocode:
        wakeWaiter(&amp;rw.readerSem)
    }
    // Allow other writers to proceed.
    rw.w.Unlock()
}
</code></pre>
<p>To lock an RWMutex for writing, you first lock the plain mutex inside it, which only writers try to do, then inform readers that there is a waiting writer. This guarantees &quot;forward progress,&quot; the property that any goroutine which attempts to lock the RWMutex – for writing or for reading – will eventually acquire it, assuming each lock is paired appropriately with an unlock. Lastly, if there were any readers at the moment this writer made its announcement, then we record the number of them in <code>rw.readerWait</code> and go to sleep.</p>
<p>Unlocking is a more interesting process. First, we open the RWMutex back up to readers. The next step is to open up the semaphore that readers acquire during <code>RLock</code> whenever there's a writer... by releasing it once for every distinct reader. In effect, every write operation guarded by an RWMutex is O(readers).</p>
<p>So, we have an important result already about the applicability of RWMutex: If the number of goroutines that might use RLock is not O(1), then an RWMutex will almost certainly be a bottleneck.</p>
<p>Now, that very well may be insignificant; often, it's more efficient to spawn <code>GOMAXPROCS</code> goroutines and delegate work among them than to spawn a new goroutine for each task, because it makes less work for the scheduler. But for things like <code>http.ListenAndServe</code> that create a goroutine per request, we can probably conclude just from reading our code whether RWMutex will be slow.</p>
<p>To summarize the protocols for RWMutex:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acquiring the rwmutex for reading:
<ol>
<li><code>Atomic(rw.readerCount += 1)</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>rw.readerCount</code> is negative, sleep while the writer finishes (in <code>Unlock</code>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Releasing the rwmutex from reading:
<ol>
<li><code>Atomic(rw.readerCount += -1)</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>rw.readerCount</code> is negative:
1.	Check the mutex was locked for reading, else panic.
2.	<code>Atomic(rw.readerWait += -1)</code>.
3.	If <code>rw.readerWait</code> is zero, wake the pending writer (sleeping in <code>Lock</code>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Acquiring the rwmutex for writing:
<ol>
<li>Lock the writer mutex. (Loop until <code>CAS(rw.w.state from 0 to 1)</code>.)</li>
<li>Make <code>rw.readerCount</code> negative to prevent more readers.</li>
<li>Set <code>rw.readerWait</code> to the number of active readers.</li>
<li>If there were any active readers, sleep until the readers finish (in <code>RUnlock</code>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Releasing the rwmutex from writing:
<ol>
<li>Make <code>rw.readerCount</code> positive, allowing readers to acquire the rwmutex.</li>
<li>If the rwmutex was not locked for writing, panic.</li>
<li>For each reader when the rwmutex was locked for writing: Wake a reader (sleeping in <code>RLock</code>).</li>
<li>Unlock the writer mutex. (<code>Atomic(rw.w.state += -1)</code>.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are more API points for RWMutex than there are for Mutex, but we can also see that any individual operation on an RWMutex does more work than any operation on a Mutex does. Well, except for one: if there are no waiting writers, acquiring an RWMutex for reading does only a single atomic addition. So that should be faster than acquiring a plain Mutex, which does a loop, right?</p>
<p>Spoiler: RWMutex can have worse performance than a plain Mutex, even if there are zero writers.</p>
<p>It depends on the hardware and on the exact usage, and it is unlikely for RLock to be quite that bad. I'll echo my initial claim: the only way to be certain whether RWMutex will perform well is to benchmark and profile. But we can make some predictions by analyzing how CPU caches work.</p>
<p>This will take a lot of words, because we are describing some of the deepest magic of hardware.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#5."><h2 id="5.">Computer, Meet Physics</h2></a>
<p>A common programming adage goes something like, &quot;Memory is fast, hard drives are slow, and networks are really slow.&quot; That's usually true, but the situation with memory is complicated.</p>
<p>Here's a simplified description of the steps involved when the CPU needs to access values stored in RAM:</p>
<ol>
<li>CPU sends an electrical signal encoding the address it wants to the memory controller.</li>
<li>Memory controller sends the electrical signal to the appropriate DIMM.</li>
<li>DIMM interface sends the electrical signal to the appropriate microcontroller.</li>
<li>Microcontroller sends the electrical signal to physical storage structures.</li>
<li>Physical storage structures gradually form a stable electrical signal representing the data they store.</li>
<li>Microcontroller sends the electrical signal to the DIMM interface.</li>
<li>... to the memory controller.</li>
<li>... to the CPU.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these operations take time. Fetching values from a typical DDR4-2400 DIMM that has 18-18-18 timings takes more than 65 nanoseconds, even being very optimistic in the calculations. This is somewhere in the vicinity of 100 to 300 CPU clock cycles during which the CPU cannot continue doing work on that thread.</p>
<p>One of the primary ways to improve computer performance is to reduce the number of operations which have to reach all the way to RAM, by introducing CPU caches. These are chunks of memory located on the CPU itself, designed to resolve quickly rather than to pack as much storage as possible onto little sticks of silicon. Each cache level is a little physically further from the CPU control unit, so it's a little slower to access, but even the deepest level of cache is orders of magnitude faster than RAM.</p>
<p>Another related innovation is the cache line. On amd64, the machine word size is eight bytes, but caches fetch and write back memory 64 bytes at a time, equivalent to eight machine words. So, programs which access nearby memory tend to issue fewer total fetches to RAM. This is the reason you often hear – and probably eventually measure – that linked lists tend to perform worse than arrays, even on operations where naïve complexity theory indicates the linked list should be much better.</p>
<p>(The cache line size was 64 bytes on most 32-bit x86 microarchitectures as well, making them sixteen machine words there. Note that I do say <em>microarchitectures</em>, i.e. the specific processor model; cache line sizes are not specified in the instruction set architecture and are allowed to differ between machines.)</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#6."><h2 id="6.">A Practical Approach to CPU Caches</h2></a>
<p>CPU caches are great! But so is multiprocessing, the technique of having the CPU run multiple programs at once to improve computer performance. Each &quot;core,&quot; or CPU thread, gets its own L1 (&quot;level 1&quot;) cache at least, often but not always shares L2 cache with some other threads, and usually shares L3 cache with all other threads. The details vary by microarchitecture. Regardless, for the CPU to function, each thread needs to be able to see the others' writes to memory.</p>
<p>But &quot;writes to memory&quot; are really &quot;writes to the thread's L1 cache&quot; so that we can get the performance gains we've been talking about. How can another thread, with its own L1 cache, see that write?</p>
<p>Many experienced programmers will tell you that in a situation where one thread reads from memory another has modified without a synchronization point between them, the read can return anything, including garbage. Such a statement is well-intended, but ultimately false. The real answer is that the CPU implements a cache coherency protocol to ensure that the reads always &quot;make sense,&quot; according to some metric of sensibility.</p>
<p>A protocol like MESI (short for Modified/Exclusive/Shared/Invalid), or one of its many derivatives, allows caches to declare which addresses – at the granularity of the cache line size – they're reading from and writing to, visible to each other. Caches can recognize when they need to push cache lines back to main memory or fetch the new state of a cache line therefrom. So, threads that simultaneously read from the same address will always see the same value, and that value will always be the present value of the same address in all L1 caches that share it.</p>
<p>The only trouble occurs when a read and a write are issued to the same address by separate threads simultaneously. Any number of reading threads accessing the location in the same cycle as a writer will see the same value, but that value may or may not be the value being written.</p>
<p>If, say, the readers were checking whether a mutex was locked, perhaps as part of a <code>CMPXCHG</code> instruction (without a <code>LOCK</code> prefix) that will change the value at the address if it currently represents &quot;unlocked,&quot; then all those threads could successfully make the swap and believe they had acquired the mutex. This does not sound like mutual exclusion.</p>
<p>(Rajiv Prabhakar has an excellent <a href="https://software.rajivprab.com/2018/04/29/myths-programmers-believe-about-cpu-caches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explanation of cache coherency</a>, if you're interested in more of these details.)</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#7."><h2 id="7."><code>LOCK</code> and Cache</h2></a>
<p>According to the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual, Volume 2A, the <code>LOCK</code> prefix &quot;[i]n a multiprocessor context ... ensures that the processor has exclusive use of any shared memory&quot; while the instruction to which it is prefixed executes. Which is to say, if another thread attempts to access the same cache line, it waits for the write to fully complete. Our write <em>happens before</em> their read – exactly what it means for a computer operation to be atomic. The reading thread's cache can then see that its version of the memory location is no longer valid, so it can fetch the value from a deeper cache level.</p>
<p>But there are a few important details about this. First, the name is <code>LOCK</code> <em>for a reason</em>. While one thread has &quot;exclusive use&quot; of a cache line, any others that want to use it have to stall, doing nothing until the privileged thread is done. If every core happens to try to atomically access the same variable at once, they have to wait in turn. Their otherwise parallel execution ends up being completely serialized – we aren't multiprocessing anymore!</p>
<p>Second, a somewhat subtler detail: once an atomic operation completes, the associated cache line needs to be invalidated <em>only if its contents changed</em>. If the cache line is unchanged, then the waiting reader knows its cached value is still valid, so it doesn't have to fetch a new version of the cache line. Which means if a thread tries to acquire an already locked mutex, <code>LOCK CMPXCHG</code> will not invalidate anyone's cache. Only when the mutex state changes are caches invalidated. In theory, a thread can spin for a mutex every few CPU cycles, locking it almost the moment it becomes available.</p>
<p>On the other hand, other atomic operations might always cause a cache line to invalidate. One example is <code>LOCK ADD</code> with a nonzero addend. Remember, &quot;<code>LOCK</code>&quot; is equivalent to &quot;atomic.&quot; This is an operation we've seen before.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#8."><h2 id="8.">RWMutex Does Not Scale</h2></a>
<p>We've finally brought the discussion back to RWMutex itself, but now we are armed with a conceptual understanding of The Caches. It was a long time ago at this point, but we once made the claim that <code>RWMutex.RLock</code> might be faster than <code>Mutex.Lock</code>. Recall its implementation:</p>
<pre><code>func (rw *RWMutex) RLock() {
    if atomic.AddInt32(&amp;rw.readerCount, 1) &lt; 0 {
        // A writer is pending, wait for it.
        runtime_SemacquireMutex(&amp;rw.readerSem, false, 0)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Atomic add, with an addend guaranteed never to be zero. The bane of valid caches.</p>
<p>Every time any goroutine attempts to <code>RLock</code> an RWMutex, it will always(-ish) need to look to caches deeper than L1, and possibly to main memory. That's dozens of wasted CPU cycles in the best case.</p>
<p>Now, on an old dual-core Pentium, cache invalidation isn't the worst thing. There's only one other thread that has to care about it, and it'll probably at least synchronize in the L2 cache, only a little further away. But on high-end consumer-grade processors with eight, twelve, or sixteen threads, or on servers with 64 or more cores, it's... not good.</p>
<p>We still haven't gotten to the worst part. Imagine we have four goroutines calling <code>RLock</code> on one RWMutex concurrently. Let's say those goroutines happen to be running in parallel on four threads, and each of those threads encounters the atomic add in the same CPU cycle. The situation ends up something like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simultaneously:
<ul>
<li>T0's <code>LOCK ADD</code> claims <code>readerCount</code>.</li>
<li>T1's <code>LOCK ADD</code> cannot claim <code>readerCount</code>. Wait.</li>
<li>T2's <code>LOCK ADD</code> cannot claim <code>readerCount</code>. Wait.</li>
<li>T3's <code>LOCK ADD</code> cannot claim <code>readerCount</code>. Wait.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>T0's <code>LOCK ADD</code> finishes. Simultaneously:
<ul>
<li>T1's <code>LOCK ADD</code> finishes waiting and claims <code>readerCount</code>.</li>
<li>T2's <code>LOCK ADD</code> finishes waiting but cannot claim. Wait again.</li>
<li>T3's <code>LOCK ADD</code> finishes waiting but cannot claim. Wait again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>T1's cache sees that its line containing <code>readerCount</code> is invalid and reads the new value from a deeper cache level.</li>
<li>T1's <code>LOCK ADD</code> finishes. Simultaneously:
<ul>
<li>T2's <code>LOCK ADD</code> finishes waiting and claims <code>readerCount</code>.</li>
<li>T3's <code>LOCK ADD</code> finishes waiting again but cannot claim. Wait.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>T2's cache sees that its line containing <code>readerCount</code> is invalid and reads the new value from a deeper cache level.</li>
<li>T2's <code>LOCK ADD</code> finishes.</li>
<li>T3's <code>LOCK ADD</code> finishes waiting and can finally run.</li>
<li>T3's cache sees that its line containing <code>readerCount</code> is invalid and reads the new value from a deeper cache level.</li>
<li>T3's <code>LOCK ADD</code> finishes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember the part about <code>LOCK</code> being a lock? In the worst-case scenario, the running time of <code>RLock</code> is actually O(readers)! Probably O(<code>GOMAXPROCS</code>) in practice, but if there are enough cores on a server that the runtime can switch goroutines on one thread in the time it takes for all the others to <code>RLock</code> – remember that <em>every</em> call forces a cache invalidation – then it's possible to hit that worse upper bound.</p>
<p>Simply put, RWMutex doesn't scale with CPU count. If more than two threads might be using it even just for reading, performance will degrade. The curve isn't steep, but it is downward. Cache contention in the RWMutex algorithm <a href="https://golang.org/issue/17973" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creates real problems</a>.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#9."><h2 id="9.">RWMutex Does Not Fit</h2></a>
<p>There is another core problem with the design of RWMutex. I've alluded to it, and it's possible you might have extrapolated some of the discussion to notice it, but now we'll consider it explicitly.</p>
<p>The cache line size for all amd64 processors is (or has been) 64 bytes. An RWMutex takes up 24 bytes. That's 37.5% of a cache line on its own. Memory fetches are granular at the cache line size, so the fact that an RWMutex takes up more than a third of that means that it's very likely the cache will have to issue an extra fetch to retrieve whatever data you're using the mutex to guard.</p>
<p>Now, this problem has much more nuance than the scaling issue. It's actually possible for the large size of the RWMutex to push unrelated data into uncontended cache lines, meaning the overall program performance might even improve! Once again, the only way to be sure is to benchmark and profile.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, though, for nice cache behavior, small objects are best. RWMutex will probably work against you more often than with you in this regard.</p>


<a class="permalink" href="#10."><h2 id="10.">So You Think You Want RWMutex</h2></a>
<p>Maybe you're converting some old algorithm to be concurrent, and channels feel like an awkward fit.
Maybe you've profiled your project and found that locking plain mutexes is a big box on the cumulative call graph.
Maybe you like to read through Go documentation, and you keep thinking about package sync.
Whatever brought you to this point, you should be aware that performance will very rarely be a reason to choose RWMutex.</p>
<p>There are, without doubt, many cases where RWMutex makes for clean and maintainable concurrent code. That should usually be your priority. However, the unfortunate reality is that there is almost always some solution that will trade more lines of code for far better performance – something more tolerant to writers, something that avoids cache contention between readers, or something that keeps hot data in cache.</p>
<p>Just wait until you see my lock-free concurrent trie:</p>
<pre><code>import (
    &quot;math/bits&quot;
    &quot;sync&quot;
    &quot;sync/atomic&quot;
    &quot;unsafe&quot;
)
</code></pre>
